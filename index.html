                                Margie: At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain.

                                <br>Evan: Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. 

                                <br>Margie: But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form.

                                <br>Andrew: On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. 

                                <br>Mark: Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience

                                <br>Evan: but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly chest.

                                <br>Margie: So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.
